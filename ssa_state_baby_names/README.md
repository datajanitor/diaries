# SSA State Baby Names

A simple script to combine all the state files of popular baby names into a single CSV, and do some basic aggregations on them.

Note: Obviously you would normally do aggregations in SQL, but since we're already in Ruby-script-land to combine the files anyway, might as well do some calculations, such as ranking, even if it's not optimal speedwise to do it in Ruby.
