# FBI UCR Bulk Data

There seems to be a lack of bulk data downloads of the important FBI Uniform Crime Reports.

Their tablemaker tool is here: http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/JurisbyJuris.cfm

The `data-source/key-state.csv` file contains the numbers (1 to 51) assigned to each state.
