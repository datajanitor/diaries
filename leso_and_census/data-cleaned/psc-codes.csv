In addition, that name may also  appear as an entry in groups other than 58.  Each such  entry refers to a distinctly different part or assembly, even though the different items have the same name. The listing of the same name in two or more classes  indicates that, in one form, the part or assembly  covered by the name is applicable to the equipment  covered by one class, and in another form is  applicable to the equipment covered by another  class.  For example, the item name CODER, AUDIO  FREQUENCY is applicable to two distinctly different assemblies, one of which has an application in  cryptologic equipment, covered by class 5810,  and the other in radar equipment covered by class 5840. Consequently the name CODER, AUDIO FREQUENCY is an entry  under each of the two classes.  When an item identification bears a name which  is indexed under more than one class of group 58, or in group 58 and in some other group, the item will be classified in the same class as its next  higher assembly in the manner described in the  Department of Defense, Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures Manual, DoD 4100.39-M.
